- **Instant Feedback**: Provide real-time assessment and constructive feedback on assignments.
- **Teacher Monitoring**: Allow teachers to track student progress and engagement.
- **Guided Assistance**: Help students do their own work instead of doing it for them.
- **LMS Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with Google Classroom and other LMS platforms.
