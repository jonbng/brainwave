## Planned Features

- **Privacy First**: Implement end-to-end encryption and strict data protection measures.

- **Instant Feedback**: Provide real-time assessment and constructive feedback on assignments.
- **Teacher Monitoring**: Allow teachers to track student progress and engagement.
- **Guided Assistance**: Help students do their own work instead of doing it for them.
- **LMS Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with Google Classroom and other LMS platforms.

## Privacy Commitment

At Brainwave, we believe in the power of AI to transform education while fiercely protecting the privacy of students and educators. Our privacy practices will include:

- **Data Encryption**: All data will be encrypted end-to-end.
